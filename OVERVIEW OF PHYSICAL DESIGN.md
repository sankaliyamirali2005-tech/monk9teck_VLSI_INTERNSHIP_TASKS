# 🚀 Monk9 Tech – ASIC Design Overview

## 📝 Project Summary
This repository provides an overview of the **ASIC Design flow and capabilities** presented in the Monk9 Tech deck. The project highlights end-to-end ASIC development, covering architecture definition, RTL design, verification, synthesis, physical design, and sign-off. It is intended for engineers, reviewers, and collaborators who want a concise understanding of the design methodology, tools, and deliverables used in the ASIC lifecycle.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Document the ASIC design approach followed by Monk9 Tech
- Provide a high-level technical reference for stakeholders
- Serve as a starting point for future design, implementation, and verification work
